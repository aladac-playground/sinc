h1. Congratulations on succesfully setting up *sinc*

The next steps to use *sinc* should be:

* Visiting you sinc folder (located in Apps/sinc subfolder of your Dropbox folder)
* Putting some text files there from which sinc will put together your simple site
* Taking a look at "Textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ to know how to easily format you micro site
